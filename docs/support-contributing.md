## ü§î Raising an issue or suggestion
This project uses GitHub Issues in order to manage upcoming changes, bugs, and issues. Please bear in mind if you are raising an issue, to abide by the code of conduct in our [CONTRIBUTING](../CONTRIBUTING.md) guidelines and to provide any steps to reproduce, screenshots, or other assets that may help us understand and resolve the issue.

If you are raising a new feature or pull request, please bear in mind that there is a desire to keep this project fairly streamlined and maintainable, not all requests will be accepted as some functionality may be intentionaly left to the implementing application.
