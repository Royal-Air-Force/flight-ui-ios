# ðŸš° What is the Kitchen Sink

## ðŸš° Kitchen Sink
The Sample application, included within this repository provides a demonstration of how to use and implement FlightUI in your own application. It does this by providing a runnable iOS application that provides a screen for each style or component available within the library including; colours, typography, spacing, and buttons.

This kitchen sink not only provides you with the code in order to use the theme components in your own app, but it also provides guidance on what should be used and when, such as informing the visual impact of each button and what they should be used for.
