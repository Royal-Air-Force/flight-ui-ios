## 👋 Introduction
FlightUI for iOS is a [Swift Package](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/xcode/swift-packages) that enables apps used by aircrew in-flight to be developed more quickly using an approved, reusable, and well-tested set of UI components that support situational accessibility needs.

Initial designs are derived from the Society of Flight Test Engineers: Guidelines for Displays [standard](https://society-of-flight-test-engineers.github.io/handbook-2013/real-time-data-display-guidelines.html). The project has been been developed in partnership with the UK Air and Space Warfare Center for use across multiple mobile projects used In-Flight across a large range of aircraft platforms.

> ⚠️ **Note**  
> Approval is currently pending, but is required before this project reaches public beta.  
> FlightUI is currently in active development, there may be significant changes or breaking issues and full approval for all components has not been given. Please keep that in mind when using this project.
